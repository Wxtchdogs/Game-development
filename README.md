Requirements:

1. Add a part to the game and add this script as a child. This will be the sword fighting enabled zone.
2. Create another a frame around the zone using unions and call it RemoveSword. Ensure this object does not overlap with the zone itself.
3. Ensure that both parts have cancollide disabled in their properties.
4. Go to toolbox and add "ClassicSword" to server storage.
